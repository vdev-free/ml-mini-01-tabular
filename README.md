# Mini-project 01 — Tabular Classification

## Goal
Build a small production-style ML project for binary classification on tabular data.
The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Dataset
We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn.
The dataset contains numeric features computed from digitized images of breast tissue.

## Scope
- Train a baseline classification model
- Use a reproducible pipeline
- Track experiments with MLflow
- Expose inference via API (later)
